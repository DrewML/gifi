So, it works exactly as advertised, watch GIFs right in your terminal while `npm install` is running.


## Demo

## Installation

```
$ npm install gifi --global
```


## Usage

Replace `npm` with `gifi` and you're done:

```
$ gifi install koa --save
```

## Key to happiness

Alias `npm` to `gifi` and you're golden, `npm install` will never be boring again.
As a matter of fact, after using gifi you'll want `npm install` to be slower, because
you don't have enough time to watch all those great GIFs.

Add this to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc:

```
alias npm=gifi
```
